NAME
    Data::CPAN::DSLIP::Explain - "decrypts" CPAN module DSLIP code

SYNOPSIS
        use strict;
        use warnings;

        use Data::CPAN::DSLIP::Explain;

        my $dslip = 'Sdcfp';

        my $obj = Data::CPAN::DSLIP::Explain->new;

        my $meaning = $obj->dslip( $dslip );

        print "\nDSLIP code `$dslip` means:\n",
                join "\n\t",
                    map {
                        $obj->explain_dslip_letter( $_ )
                        . "\n\t\t$meaning->{$_}"
                    } qw(D S L I P);

        print "\n\n----\n";

DESCRIPTION
    The module explains the DSLIP codes for those of us who have bad memory.
    DSLIP stands for Development Stage, Support Level, Language Used,
    Interface Style, Public License. DSLIP codes is what'd you'd see in CPAN
    module list.

METHODS
  new
        my $object = Data::CPAN::DSLIP::Explain->new;

    Creates and returns a new Data::CPAN::DSLIP::Explain object. Takes no
    arguments.

  dslip
        my $meaning = $object->dslip( 'Sdcfp' );
        my @meanings = $object->dslip( qw( Sdcfp Sdcfp Sdcfp ) );

        $VAR1 = {
            'D' => 'Standard, supplied with Perl',
            'S' => 'Developer',
            'L' => 'C and perl, a C compiler will be needed'
            'I' => 'plain Functions, no references used',
            'P' => 'Standard-Perl: user may choose between GPL and Artistic',
        };

    Takes one or more arguments which should be DSLIP codes. In scalar
    context returns the meaning of the first DSLIP in a form of a hashref.
    In list context returns a list of explanations for one or several DSLIP
    code passed as arguments. The meaning is a hashref with keys being each
    of the letters of DSLIP:

    D   Will contain *Development Stage* of the module.

    S   Will contain *Support Level* of the module.

    L   Will contain module's *Language Used*.

    I   Will contain description of module's *Interface Style*.

    P   Will contain module's *Public License* type.

  explain_dslip_letter
        my $D_means = $object->explain_dslip_letter('D');
        my $S_means = $object->explain_dslip_letter('S');
        my $L_means = $object->explain_dslip_letter('L');
        my $I_means = $object->explain_dslip_letter('I');
        my $P_means = $object->explain_dslip_letter('P');

    Takes one argument which is a letter of DSLIP acronym and returns an
    explaination of what that letter stands for. In other words
    $object->explain_dslip_letter('S'); would return "Support Level".
